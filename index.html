    <p>A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre o f Communism. All the Powers o f old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcize this spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police spies.</p>
    <p>W here is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power? W here the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach o f Communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?</p>
    <p>Two things result from this fact:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Communism is already acknowledged by all European Powers to be itself a Power.</li>
        <li>It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face o f the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale o f the Spectre o f Com m unism with a Manifesto o f the party itself.</li>
